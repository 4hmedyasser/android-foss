# Criteria

Each listed software has to meet following criteria:

1. Licensed as *Free and Open Source Software*
1. Source code available
1. Keeps Privacy – No Advertisement, no Spyware!
1. No proprietary elements
1. Stable (at least stable to use) – *if possible*
1. Actively developed, maintained or supported – *if possible*
1. Documentation available (Project website etc.)
1. Free of charge

It's also useful if it's already available on *F-Droid*. If not yet, it's also a good idea to promote this to the projects developer.

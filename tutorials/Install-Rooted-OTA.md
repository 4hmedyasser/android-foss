# Installation of OTA on a Rooted Device

The installation of OTA updates often fails if the device has been rooted. Though it's still possible â€“ without data loss. This guide shows how, using *TWRP* and *Magisk*.

***IMPORTANT:** Before you start **backup** everything that's important! Proceed at own risk!*

-------------------------------------

## Prerequisite

1. The Update file of the version that's already running on the device (*NOT* the update you want to install)
1. [**TWRP**](https://twrp.me/) for your device
1. [**Magisk**](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445)
1. *ADB* and *Fastboot* inclusive developer mode the device

Don't forget to check the checksums of all files.

Doing the update isn't that difficult: Reset some system partitions, install OTA, refresh *TWPR* and *Magisk*, done. There are two versions of this guide: The short version is just a list of steps, while the long version contains each step and the commands necessary.


## Short Version

1. Download the Update *current installed*
1. Enable USB Debugging
1. Boot to Bootloader
1. Flash *recovery*, *system* and *boot* images
1. Reboot
1. Flash *TWRP*
1. Boot to Recovery
1. Install *Magisk*
1. Reboot


-------------------------------------

## Long Version

At first double check your backups and the prerequisites listed above. 


### Preparation

##### Stock files of current running version

Download the update file for the version running on your device, not the version you want to install. Given you are running on v1.2.3 and want to update to v1.2.4, you need the v1.2.3 file. 

Unpack the downloaded file, you need: `recovery.img`, `system.img` and `boot.img`.

##### Enable USB Debugging

Plug the divce to your computer throuth USB and and enable *USB Debugging* on the device.


### Flash System Files

Open a terminal and use these commands to flash the necessary partitions (don't type the `$`).

```sh
# Check if device is recognized
> adb devices

# Boot into bootloader
> adb reboot bootloader

# Check device again in Bootloader
> fastboot devices

# Flash recovery image
> fastboot flash recovery recovery.img

# Flash system image
> fastboot flash system system.img

# Flash boot image
> fastboot flash boot boot.img

# Reboot device
> fastboot reboot
```
